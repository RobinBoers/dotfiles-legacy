# i3

i3 is my first tiling window manager. My config has a topbar with workspaces, info, systray and time/date.  
For my i3 setup I use the default bar/panel (i3bar) that I customized a bit. I also added some keybindings for stuff. I use both dmenu and rofi. I made the themes for both match the i3bar theme. Also using nitrogen for the wallpaper here. For both the GTK+ and QT theme Im using Breeze. Terminal is Konsole. Breeze icons.

Dependencies: `nm-applet, rofi, dmenu, firefox, alacritty, nitrogen, pactl, dmenu, betterlockscreen, xcape`

# Keybindings

These are most important, the rest can be found in the config file.

| Keybind | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Super | launch rofi |
| Super+d | launch dmenu |
| Super+q | kill focused window |
| Super+w | lauch firefox |
| Ctrl+Alt+q | exit openbox |
| Ctrl+Alt+r | reload/restart openbox |
