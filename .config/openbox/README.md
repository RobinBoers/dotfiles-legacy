# Openbox

Openbox is my favorite floating window manager. It is lightweight, fast and customizable. My openbox config uses nitrogen for wallpapers and has a pretty simple menu. I'm using Adwaita Dark for GTK+ and Kvantum Gnome Dark for QT. The Openbox theme is Arc-Dark and I'm using plank for a dock. For searching and application lauching I'm using rofi. The icon theme is Yaru.

Dependencies: `firefox, alacritty, pactl, xbacklight, playerctl, rofi, dunst, lxsession, nitrogen, betterlockscreen, xcape, lxappearance`
