# Rofi

These are my rofi themes. I use Rofi for a lot of things, so there are a lot of different themes here.

- `alttab.rasi`: I made this theme for when I was using rofi as an alternative window switcher on elementaryOS. [More info...](https://gist.github.com/RobinBoers/56022f6e185c3e91dd8186bd657228b9#use-rofi-as-alternative-alttab-switcher)
- `dmenu.rasi`: This is a dmenu style theme for my i3 setup. [More info...](../i3/)
- `float.rasi`: Just a cool theme for launchers. A fork of the default paper-float theme by Qball.
- `hud.rasi`: The theme used for the hud in my Metacity session. [More info...](../../usr/bin/)
- `ob.rasi`: The theme used in my openbox setup. [More info...](../openbox/)
- `ob-new`: A version of `hud.rasi` with icons. Used as applauncher in my Metacity session.
- `qmenu.rasi`: A version of `dmenu.rasi` for my qtile setup. [More info...](../qtile/
