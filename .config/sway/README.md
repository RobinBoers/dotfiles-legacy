# Sway setup

This is my current setup. I'm using sworkstyle for workspace labels, autotiling for autotiling (duh), swaylock-effects for screenlocking and [swaybg-random](../../usr/bin/swaybg-random) for the wallpaper. I also have a script that moves me to the next empty workspace when I hit Super+T.
