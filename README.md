# dotfiles
My personal dotfiles. I use the Arc-Dark theme for openbox,<br>
the Adwaita-Dark theme for GTK+ and the Yaru icon theme.

I also added some config files for different applications, like Windows Terminal, vscode and atom.

If the rofi theme doesnt work, try installing rofi 1.6.1 from source or remove the  configuration part (the icons)
