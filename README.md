# dotfiles
My dotfiles for various programs and setups.

### Openbox setup
I use the Arc-Dark theme for openbox,  
the Adwaita-Dark theme for GTK+ and the Yaru icon theme.

The dock (plank) is on the left like in unity and for the wallpaper Im using nitrogen.

### i3 setup
For my i3 setup I use the default bar/panel (i3bar) that I customized a bit. I also added some keybindings for stuff. I use both dmenu and rofi. I made the themes for both match the i3bar theme. Also using nitrogen for the wallpaper here. For both the GTK+ and QT theme Im using Breeze. Terminal is Konsole. Breeze icons.

Dependencies: `nm-applet, rofi, dmenu, firefox, alacritty, nitrogen, pactl, dmenu, betterlockscreen, xcape`

### Qtile setup
Also using the default panel in this setup. I customized it to use the frontend-delight color theme. I use gaps because I like them. Keybindings for most regular stuff. Also keybinded the media buttons using playerctl and the brightness stuff with xbacklight. Using kvantum KvGnome for QT and Adwaita dark for GTK+. Using nitrogen for the wallpaper and using Breeze icons.

Dependencies: `firefox, alacritty, pactl, xbacklight, playerctl, rofi, dunst, lxsession, nitrogen, betterlockscreen, xcape`
